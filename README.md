# Internship Tools Workshop

**A joint collaboration between TSE and HKN @ UCSD.**

In this workshop, we covered the following tools:

* Confluence/Jira
* Docker
* MongoDB
* Python 3+

In this activity, we'll be building an application that uses all four of those tools.
This application will be a simple CLI-based note-taking application. More details below.
